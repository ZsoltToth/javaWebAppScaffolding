 * Your core module should define the service interfaces.
 * These services define the functionality of your application.
 * Use-Case diagrams can help to outline these services.
 * Services also can be defined by abstract classes.

 * A service definition should contain
 *  - method name
 *  - return type
 *  - parameters
 *  - exceptions
 *  - documentation
